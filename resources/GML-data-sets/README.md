# GML data sets

The Geography Markup Language is the XML grammar defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium to express geographical features.

In ETF, we validate if the data sets follow the basic requirements for the GML encoding for spatial data sets in INSPIRE.

In this folder there are some predefined data sets that you can validate. 

If the validation doesn't work, you can try to fix it.
