# WMS services

A Web Map Service is a standard protocol developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium in 1999 for serving georeferenced map images over the Internet. These images are typically produced by a map server from data provided by a GIS database. 

In ETF, we validate if these services follow the basic requirements for WMS services set by INSPIRE

In this folder there are some services that you can validate. If the validation doesn't work, you can try to fix them.
