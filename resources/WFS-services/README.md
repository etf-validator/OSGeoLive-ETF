# WFS services

The Web Feature Service (WFS) represents a change in the way geographic information is created, modified and exchanged on the Internet. Rather than sharing geographic information at the file level, the WFS offers direct fine-grained access to geographic information at the feature and feature property level.

In ETF, we validate if these services follow the basic requirements for WFS services set by INSPIRE

In this folder there are some services that you can validate. If the validation doesn't work, you can try to fix them.
