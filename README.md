# OSGeoLive-ETF
Test suites, packages and resources for OSGeoLive.

## Resources
Inside the folder *resources* you can find sample data for testing, grouped by resource type. 
Some of these resources won't pass all the tests, so if you want you can try to fix them before validating it again. 
This way you will be able to practice on how to use the validation of ETF.

### Resources availables

At this moment there 3 available types of tests resources. These are:
- GML data sets
- WMS services
- WFS services
